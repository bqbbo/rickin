      This website was a mini-project/fun thing I worked on with time.<br>
      This serves no purpose and was made entirely for fun.

      Access to all files and code can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/dacoder101/rickin">GitHub repository.</a><br>
      I learned a lot of new HTML, CSS, and JS skills I wouldn't have bothered to learn, if not for websites like <a href="https://w3schools.org">w3Schools</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.<br>
      The base front-end development knowledge I knew was some self-taught, but was gained from the Responsive Web Design course on <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>.<br>
      Navbar styling was inspired by w3schools.
