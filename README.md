# rickin - "Rick Astley's pride and joy"

Rickin is a static HTML website created as a joke around Rick Astley's "memeified" persona.
It was one of my first larger-scale projects using GitHub and GitHub Codespaces, and it explored some concepts I was unfamiliar with.
It was also one of the last projects I ever made without the assistance of generative AI. CSS was inspired by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) examples.

This project integrates with another one of my meme projects, [savers](https://github.com/dacoder101/savers), which was created in combination as an easter egg.

I am no longer maintaining the project but it is open to contributions in the spirit of Rick Astley.

*"Never gonna give you up..."*
