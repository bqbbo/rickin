Rick Astley's pride and joy.

Honestly, just go see it for yourself.

Originally started on Replit, some _bad **bad**_ stuff happened, so I looked into some alternative options.
Had never really used GitHub, but had an account that I've been kinda using, so decided I would use CodeSpaces instead of Replit.

**DISCLAIMER:**_This is **NOT** Replit's fault, and it is a great website to use, which I will still continue to use for most projects, but after an issue occured, I could no longer use Replit for any of my HTML projects. https://replit.com/__

good luck keeping braincellz
