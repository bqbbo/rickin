Note to Contributers and Developers:

Developers:

**ONLY Edit dev branch**, **DO NOT** create a new branch for pull request.

Once the code on dev branch is complete, it can be pushed to main after being checked using a pull request, and review from the owner.

Contributers:

**Please ONLY** fork dev branch, and check if any edits were made to the file you edited if you did not create a new one. Please every so offen fetch the latest edits from dev to avoid conflicts during the pull.

This pull request will be pushed into **dev**, not into main so we can best incorporate this into the project. This is the reason you should **NOT** fork main, because all features that need to be commited to main will not exist until the next pull, and could cause problems/conflicts.

Thank you!
