Note to Contributers and Developers:

Developers:

**ONLY Edit dev branch**, **DO NOT** create a new branch for pull request.

Once the code on dev branch is complete, it can be pushed to main after being checked using a pull request, these can go reviewless, but please be sure to check if any mistakes were made. If so, undo the pull and fix issues, or create another pull fixing issues.

Contributers:

**Please ONLY** fork dev branch, and check if any edits were made to the file you edited if you did not create a new one. Please every so offen fetch the latest edits from dev to avoid conflicts during the pull.

This pull request will be pushed into **dev**, not into main so we can best incorporate this into the project. This is the reason you should **NOT** fork main, because all features that need to be commited to main will not exist until the next pull, and could cause problems/conflicts.

**Thank you!**
